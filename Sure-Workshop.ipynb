        "This method of logical analysis is what essentially distinguishes the new empiricism and positivism from the earlier one, which was more biologically-psychologically oriented. When someone claims: \"There is no God\", \"The primal foundation of the world is the unconscious\" [...] we don't tell them: \"What you say is false\"; instead, we ask them: \"What do you mean by your statements?\" And then it turns out that there is a sharp boundary between two types of statements. To one group belong the statements made in empirical science; their meaning can be determined through logical analysis, more precisely: by reducing them to the simplest statements about empirically given things. The other statements, including the ones mentioned earlier, turn out to be completely meaningless if one takes them as the metaphysician means them.\n",
